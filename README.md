## Android Installation Guide

To install HiOSMobile on your Android device, please follow these steps:

2.  **Access Downloaded File:** Open your device's file management application (such as the built-in "Files" app or Google Files, available on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.nbu.files) if not installed). Locate the **Downloads** folder and tap the downloaded `.apk` file.

3.  **Enable Unknown Sources (if prompted):** If you haven't previously installed applications from outside the Google Play Store, your device may prompt you to allow installation from "Unknown Apps." Follow the on-screen instructions to enable this permission for your file management application.
